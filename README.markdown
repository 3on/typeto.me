typeto.me
---------

typeto.me is a character-level realtime chat, like the old talk program on Unix
and Unix-like operating systems.

This is made possible via [socket.io](http://socket.io) and Google's [js diff library](http://code.google.com/p/google-diff-match-patch/).

Code currently (c) Derek Arnold until a license is decided upon.

Derek did all the work; [Daniel](http://3e.org/dmd/) nagged him to do it.
